        <h3>01. Keep your homepage minimalistic and free of clutter</h3>
        Your website's homepage shoukd communicate your core message instantaneously. After all,
        we rarely read every word on a website. Instead, we quickly scan the page,picking out key words,
        sentences and images, with these known behaviors in mind, it's better to to appeal to emotions
        rather than word count.
